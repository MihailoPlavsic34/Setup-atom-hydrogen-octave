# Download and Install Atom
# Download and install juypter notebooks
# Install Jupyter
# Install octave kernel for Jupyter
# Start Atom
# Install Packages
#  - Hydrogen
#  - file-type
# setup file extension mapping
# run hydrogen


# Assumptions
  1. We will be using .m file extension for octave file-types
  2. We are using python 3. This has not been tested with python2.
  3. We are on a Mac
  4. your have brew and brew cask installed
  

# Install Atom
  a. direct install
    1. download from https://atom.io/
    2. install from wherever you downloaded it (likely ~Downloads )
  b. brew install
    1. brew cask install atom

# Install Jupyter
  a. pip install
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install jupyter

# Install octave kernel for Jupyter
  pip install octave_kernel
  python -m octave_kernel.install

# Start Atom
  a. application -> atom

# Install Packages
  a. Hydrogen
    1. Atom -> Preferences -> install -> search for and install hydrogen
  b. file-type
    2. Atom -> Preferences -> install -> search for and install file-type

# setup file extension mapping
  Without this step, .m file extensions will be executed under matlab scope
  a. Atom -> Config... -> add snipit below under "*":

    "file-types":
      "m": "source.octave"

    e.g.
    "*":
      "file-types":
        "m": "source.octave"

# run hydrogen
  restart
  run example
