# learn-atom-hydrogen-octave

**Atom is great** - nice text editor Â 
**Hydrogen is great** - inline results, like iPython, but in my text editor. Very cool!  
**Octave is great** - easy syntax, great for prototyping  

Getting all of them to work together... slightly not so great...

For my owner personal benifit, and now yours, I have put together instructs for getting them all to play nicely together.
